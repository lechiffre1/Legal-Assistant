# Multilingual Legal Assistant

A comprehensive AI-powered toolkit for legal queries, case analysis, document generation, and clause extraction across both Kenyan and German legal systems. Built as a capstone project for the Google & Kaggle 5-Day Generative AI Workshop in Q1 2025.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Legal Query**: Ask jurisdiction-specific legal questions in English or German and receive accurate, contextual responses.
-   **Case Analysis**: Analyze case law with customizable detail levels, search for specific cases, or upload case documents for AI-powered examination.
-   **Document Generation**: Create professionally formatted legal documents tailored to Kenyan or German conventions and requirements.
-   **Clause Analysis**: Extract and analyze clauses from legal documents by uploading PDFs for AI-powered structure recognition.

## üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used

-   **Google Gemini API**: Uses gemini-2.0-flash or falls back to gemini-1.5-flash for natural language generation and reasoning
-   **Vector Embeddings**: Implements both Chroma (primary) and a custom SimpleVectorStore (fallback) for semantic search
-   **PyPDF2**: Processes uploaded PDFs for clause extraction and document analysis
-   **LangChain**: Orchestrates AI workflows with Google's Generative AI embeddings
-   **Gradio**: Provides a simple intuitive, tab-based UI with jurisdiction selection

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lechiffre1/Legal-Assistant.git
cd Legal-Assistant

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then run:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai langchain-google-genai langchain gradio numpy PyPDF2 requests

```

### 3. Set API Credentials

Obtain a Google Gemini API key and optional Google Custom Search Engine ID:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-gemini-api-key'
export GOOGLE_CSE_ID='your-search-id'  # Optional for web search functionality

```

On Windows, use `set` instead of `export`.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py

```

This builds sample vector stores for both jurisdictions and starts the Gradio UI.

### 5. Access the Gradio UI

Visit the provided URL (typically http://127.0.0.1:7860) to use the interface.

## üéØ Usage

Select Kenya or Germany in the interface, then choose a feature:

Tab

Example Input

Expected Output

Legal Query

## üñ•Ô∏è Implementation Highlights

-   **Fault-Tolerant Vector Storage**: Falls back to SimpleVectorStore when Chroma isn't available
-   **Multi-Format Document Processing**: Handles both text and PDF uploads across features
-   **Jurisdiction-Aware Responses**: Adapts content to either common law (Kenya) or civil law (Germany) contexts
-   **Expandable Document Templates**: Includes jurisdiction-specific document types with appropriate formatting

## üö¶ Limitations & Troubleshooting

-   **API Quotas**: You may encounter quota limitations with the free tier of Google's Gemini API
-   **Sample Data**: Currently includes limited sample legal documents; expand with your own jurisdiction-specific content
-   **Error Handling**: System role errors can occur with certain API versions; the application includes fallbacks
-   **Memory Usage**: Processing large PDFs may require additional memory allocation
